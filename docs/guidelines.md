These guidelines ensure that AI-generated code maintains high accessibility standards and leverages the full power of this accessibility package.

## Implementation Best Practices

When implementing these guidelines in your development workflow:

1. **Integrate with your AI tools**: Add these guidelines to your AI editor/model configuration
2. **Validate accessibility**: Use the package's contrast checking functions to verify color combinations
3. **Test with real users**: Guidelines are a starting point - always test with actual users who rely on accessibility features
4. **Stay updated**: Accessibility standards evolve, so keep your guidelines current
